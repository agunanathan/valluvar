            Thiruvalluvar was a Tamil poet and philosopher who lived in the ancient Tamil country, which is now part of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. 
            He is believed to have lived sometime between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, although the exact dates of his life are not known.

            Thiruvalluvar is best known for his work, the Thirukkural, a collection of 1,330 couplets (or Kurals) that deal with various aspects of life, 
            such as ethics, morality, love, and governance.
            The Thirukkural is considered one of the greatest works of Tamil literature and has been translated into many languages.

            Thiruvalluvar's philosophy emphasizes the importance of virtue, righteousness, and non-violence. 
            He believed that a person's actions should be guided by their conscience and that they should always strive to do what is right, regardless of the consequences. 
            His teachings have had a profound impact on Tamil culture and have inspired generations of people to lead virtuous and meaningful lives.
